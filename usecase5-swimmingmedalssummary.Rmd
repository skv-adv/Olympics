## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r usecase5 swimdata}
### Kalai code starts here -scraping
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(httr) # httr: Tools for Working with URLs and HTTP 
library(curl)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(rvest)
library(jsonlite)
library(readxl)
library(lubridate)
library(openxlsx)
library(dplyr)
library(stringi)

url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_Summer_Olympics"
extractdata <- url[1] %>% read_html() %>% html_table(fill = TRUE)
Swimming_Medal_Summary_byNations <- extractdata[[11]] %>% select(2,6)
Swimming_Medal_Summary_byNations
### Kalai code ends here -scraping

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
